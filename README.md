# Hello-world
Hi visitor...
I'm Hassan, an ambitious person, always trying to 
be the best among the crowd, looking to solve 
complex problems, therefore, it always curiously 
motivates me to push my knowledge beyond the limit 
of my work, eager to learn new technologies and 
keep up with all the new solutions. I have a dream
of bieng a software developer, not a normal one,
but a great architect, a chief in the field. I'm
putting my stones one after one, waiting to finish 
my building, and when i finish it i will go away
but it will be exist to help humanity with my name
on it
